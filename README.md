# Hellscape-Showcase
A version of the Hellscape Project edited for a public showcase. Due to the files being publically downloadable I had to replace the marketplace assets with placeholders. Mind the MSPaint!

# Running the Project
This project is made to be opened with the Unreal 4 Editor using version 4.26.2. Once this version is installed on your computer, you should be able to view the project by running the "Hellscape.uproject" file in the project's root directory.

The source code can be viewed by running the "Hellscape.sln" file in the root directory, though you will need Visual Studio downloaded to do so. 

# Compiling Source Code
The source code should already be compiled in this project. However if you would like to test edits to the source code, the best way to do this is to build and run the project from Visual Studio. This can done by running Visual Studio's debugger using the "Play" button found near the top of the window ("F5" is the hotkey in case you can't find it).

DO NOT use the Unreal Editor's "Compile" button, as this is prone to giving you compile errors for no apparent reason.
